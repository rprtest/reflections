When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we want to share code and collaborate with other users.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because locally you may be working on the same files and changes may get overwritten if Git pulls automatically
