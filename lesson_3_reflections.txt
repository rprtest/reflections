When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we want to share code and collaborate with other users.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because locally you may be working on the same files and changes may get overwritten if Git pulls automatically

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - Used on Github to make a copy of another repository without affecting the orginal repository.
Clones - Clones are used to make copies of repositories to/from github/local machine.
Clones are used so that multiple users may work on same repository from their local machines and be able to push the changes to a single common github repository.
Branches -- allow users to create differnt code paths in their repository so that users cn work on different features that can be merged into the master later.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It helps to keep track of our local branch and see if we are ahead, behind or out of sync with the remote files even if we cannot acceess github.
It also helps in merging the changes from out local branch to the local copy of the remote and then push it to github.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Via emails or using common files to edit. It is easier to use than git/ github but will not be able to keep track of many changes or large number of files.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
By making changes in a seperate branch, users can safely make any updates without breaking the master. Also, by using pull requests, it can be 
reviewed by other users before it can be committed to the master.
