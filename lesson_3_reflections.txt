When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we want to share code and collaborate with other users.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because locally you may be working on the same files and changes may get overwritten if Git pulls automatically

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - Used on Github to make a copy of another repository without affecting the orginal repository.
Clones - Clones are used to make copies of repositories to/from github/local machine.
Clones are used so that multiple users may work on same repository from their local machines and be able to push the changes to a single common github repository.
Branches -- allow users to create differnt code paths in their repository so that users cn work on different features that can be merged into the master later.
