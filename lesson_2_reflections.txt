On initializing a repository a .git folder containing details is added to the folder.
This initializes the repository so that the files and its changes in it can be tracked.

Staging area is in between the working directory and the repository. 
It allows the files to be added before the final commit is made.

By adding 1 logical change from working directory to the staging area and then commiting it.
By using git diff command one can see the files changed in the working directory, staging area and the repository.

Branches are useful in the case where some changes to the code are to be done while keeping the main master code intact.
Branches are useful incase of new features or experimental features that may be merged into the master later.

Diagrams help to visualize the master and it different branches.
